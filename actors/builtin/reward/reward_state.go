// Minting Function: Taylor series expansion
//
// Intent
//   The intent of the following code is to compute the desired fraction of
//   coins that should have been minted at a given epoch according to the
//   simple exponential decay supply. This function is used both directly,
//   to compute simple minting, and indirectly, to compute baseline minting
//   by providing a synthetic "effective network time" instead of an actual
//   epoch number. The prose specification of the simple exponential decay is
//   that the unminted supply should decay exponentially with a half-life of
//   6 years. The formalization of the minted fraction at epoch t is thus:
//
//                            (            t             )
//                            ( ------------------------ )
//                      ( 1 )^( [# of epochs in 6 years] )
//           f(t) = 1 - ( - )
//                      ( 2 )
// Challenges
//
// 1. Since we cannot rely on floating-point computations in this setting, we
//    have resorted to using an ad-hoc fixed-point standard. Experimental
//    testing with the relevant scales of inputs and with a desired "atto"
//    level of output precision yielded a recommendation of a 97-bit fractional
//    part, which was stored in the constant "MintingOutputFixedPoint".
//    Fractional input is only necessary when considering "effective network
//    time"; there, the desired precision is determined by the minimum
//    plausible ratio between realized network power and network baseline,
//    which is set in "MintingInputFixedPoint".
//
// !IMPORTANT!: the time input to this function should be a factor of
//   2^MintingInputFixedPoint greater than the semantically intended value, and
//   the return value from this function is a factor of 2^MintingOutputFixedPoint
//   greater. The semantics of the output value will always be a fraction
//   between 0 and 1, but will be represented as an integer between 0 and
//   2^FixedPoint. The expectation is that callers will multiply the result by
//   some number, and THEN right-shift the result of the multiplication by
//   FixedPoint bits, thus implementing fixed-point multiplication by the
//   returned fraction.  Analogously, if callers intend to pass in an integer
//   "t", it should be left-shifted by MintingInputFixedPoint before being
//   passed; if it is fractional, its fractional part should be
//   MintingInputFixedPoint bits long.
//
// 2. Since we do not have a math library in this setting, we cannot directly
//    implement the intended closed form using stock implementations of
//    elementary functions like exp and ln. Not even powf is available.
//    Instead, we have manipulated the function into a form with a tractable
//    Taylor expansion, and then implemented the fixed-point Taylor expansion
//    in an efficient way.
//
// Mathematical Derivation
//
//   Note that the function f above is analytically equivalent to:
//
//                    (   ( 1 )              1                 )
//                    ( ln( - ) * ------------------------ * t )
//                    (   ( 2 )   [# of epochs in 6 years]     )
//        f(t) = 1 - e
//
//   We define λ = -ln(1/2)/[# of epochs in 6 years]
//               = -ln(1/2)*([Seconds per epoch] / (6 * [Seconds per year]))
//   such that
//                    -λt
//        f(t) = 1 - e
//
//   Now, we substitute for the exponential its well-known Taylor series at 0:
//
//                 infinity     n
//                   \```` (-λt)
//        f(t) = 1 -  >    ------
//                   /,,,,   n!
//                   n = 0
//
//   Simplifying, and truncating to the empirically necessary precision:
//
//                  24           n
//                \```` (-1)(-λt)
//        f(t) =   >    ----------
//                /,,,,     n!
//                n = 1
//
//   This is the final mathematical form of what is computed below. What remains
//   is to explain how the series calculation is carried out in fixed-point.
//
// Algorithm
//
//   The key observation is that each successive term can be represented as a
//   rational number, and derived from the previous term by simple
//   multiplications on the numerator and denominator. In particular:
//   * the numerator is the previous numerator multiplied by (-λt)
//   * the denominator is the previous denominator multiplied by n
//   We also need to represent λ itself as a rational, so the denominator of
//   the series term is actually multiplied by both n and the denominator of
//   lambda.
//
//   When we have the numerator and denominator for a given term set up, we
//   compute their fixed-point fraction by left-shifting the numerator before
//   performing integer division.
//
//   Finally, at the end of each loop, we remove unnecessary bits of precision
//   from both the numerator and denominator accumulators to control the
//   computational complexity of the bigint multiplications.

// The following are the numerator and denominator of -ln(1/2)=ln(2),

// strings because literals cannot be this long; they are stored as separate
